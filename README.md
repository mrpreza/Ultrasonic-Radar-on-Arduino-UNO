# Ultrasonic-Radar-on-Arduino-UNO
This Arduino code implements a radar system using a servo motor, ultrasonic sensor, and Nokia 5110 display. The servo sweeps back and forth in a 180-degree arc while an ultrasonic sensor measures distances to objects; when objects are detected within 30cm, their positions are displayed as lines on the circular radar display, and a buzzer sounds if objects are closer than 20cm. The system continuously updates the display with each servo movement, creating a real-time radar visualization effect where the scanning line rotates and detected objects appear as marks on the radar screen.
